# ChessBoard
A fully functional JavaScript chessboard. 

This is a standalone chessboard with functions for piece movement, board clear, and other QOL commands. 
However, ChessBoard is not anything more than a flexible chess representation--basically a digital representation of a physical board. There is no moveset validation, no AI, and no notion of the rules of chess. Instead, ChessBoard can be paired with scripts for logic (ChessLogic) and a standalone AI (PandaAI).
